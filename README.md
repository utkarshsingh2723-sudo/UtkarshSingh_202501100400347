## Key Features

This project meets all the core requirements outlined in the assignment brief:

- **HTML Structure:**  
  A valid HTML5 boilerplate is used to ensure the document is properly structured.

- **Semantic Elements:**  
  The content is organized with headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and sections (`<section>`) for clear readability and navigation.

- **Text Formatting:**  
  Text formatting, including bold, italic, `<u>underline</u>`, and `<s>strikethrough</s>`, is applied to highlight specific content.

- **Images:**  
  The page includes at least two images: one for a travel destination and one for a travel activity.

- **Hyperlinks:**  
  Three types of hyperlinks are included: an internal jump link, an external link that opens in a new tab, and a link to return to the homepage.

- **Lists:**  
  All three types of lists are used to present information:
  - **Ordered List:** "Top 5 Travel Destinations"
  - **Unordered List:** "Travel Essentials to Pack"
  - **Definition List:** Defines three travel-related terms.

- **Table:**  
  A table with at least 4 rows and 3 columns is used to display travel packages with a header for "Destination," "Price," and "Duration."

- **Comments:**  
  HTML comments are strategically placed before each major section to explain the code's purpose and ensure proper documentation.
